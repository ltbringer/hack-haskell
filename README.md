## Introduction

Testing my proficiency in Haskell using problems from ~~leetcode.com~~ [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The plan is to deliberately practice

- Immutable data structures
- Recursion, tail whenever possible
- Thinking about solutions apart from the usual imperative approach

# Problems

The first 3 problems were from leetcode.com, but since then I have moved on to hackerrank for Haskell.

| # | Problem                        | Solution                        | Tests                                             |
